        <h2>Description</h2>
        
        <p><strong>Steak</strong> is a food that can be described as tender, flavorful, juicy, and cooked to perfection; in fact, most consumers describe their ideal steak as just that: "A tender, flavorful, medium-rare steak that isn't overly salty." "Tender, juicy, cooked perfectly and perfectly seasoned. A good steak is juicy, tender, loaded with flavor, and has a minimum amount of fat. Lean is the cherry-red part of the meat. The fat is the white part of the meat. Fat is a waste item on a steak."</p>
